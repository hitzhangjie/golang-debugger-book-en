## Ready to Learn DWARF

Looking back, we have built a solid foundation:

- Chapters 1-2 introduced the author's motivation for sharing this book's content;
- Chapter 3 covered professional terminology in the debugging field;
- Chapter 4 explored debugging fundamentals together, including purposes, required support, and security-focused anti-debugging measures;
- Chapter 5 analyzed both functional and non-functional requirements for debuggers, clarifying what we need to build;
- Chapter 6 implemented a relatively complete instruction-level debugger, detailing the low-level control mechanisms for debugging;
- Chapter 7 laid the groundwork for symbolic debugger development, dedicating significant effort to understanding ELF file structure organization, symbols, debug symbols, and how the compiler toolchain generates and utilizes them.

For readers who have persevered to this point - excellent work üëç, you deserve a round of applause. While we can't say you've surpassed others, you've certainly surpassed yourself.

In Chapter 8, we'll formally enter the world of DWARF, learning the DWARF debugging information standard together, mastering how it describes code and data, and glimpsing DWARF's sophisticated abstract modeling capabilities for different high-level languages. You'll discover that beyond its complexity, DWARF also has aspects that are advanced, powerful, and beautiful.
