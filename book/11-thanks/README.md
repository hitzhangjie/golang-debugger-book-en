## Acknowledgments

Throughout this journey, I have experienced both success and failure. I am grateful to my parents for being my strong support system. Even in the face of uncertainty, their encouragement has always given me infinite confidence to navigate through the fog.

I would like to thank my wife for tolerating my neglect of family life and my countless broken promises while writing this book. Without her tolerance, understanding, care, and encouragement, I might not have persevered until now.

I also want to express my gratitude to friends, colleagues, and other contributors for their support and encouragement.

Finally, I want to thank myself for the exploration, pursuit, and persistence of value.
