## The Development History and Future Prospects of eBPF Technology

### 1. The Problem Background of eBPF's Birth

Operating system tracing and monitoring have always been crucial means for system performance analysis and troubleshooting. Before eBPF, Linux systems had various tracing technologies, but they operated independently, lacking unity and flexibility:

#### Limitations of Traditional Tracing Technologies

* **Dynamic Tracing (kprobe/uprobe)**: Allows inserting probes at kernel or user-space function entries and returns, but is complex to use and requires special toolchains.
* **Static Tracing (tracepoint)**: Predefined static detection points in the kernel with limited coverage.
* **Hardware Performance Counters (PMC)**: Provides hardware-level event monitoring but is difficult to correlate with software-level events.
* **Timer Sampling**: Like perf sampling, has high overhead and may miss critical events.

These tools each had their own system, with inconsistent usage methods, leading to high learning and usage costs. More importantly, most required privileged access and couldn't provide fine-grained security control.

#### Pain Points in System Monitoring

In the context of cloud computing's rise, traditional tracing technologies faced several key challenges:

1. **Performance Overhead**: Many tracing tools introduced significant performance penalties, making them unsuitable for production environments.
2. **Security Risks**: Some tools required root privileges, potentially causing system instability or security risks.
3. **Scalability**: As system scale increased, the number of trace points surged, making analysis difficult.
4. **Lack of Flexibility**: Difficulty in customizing tracing behavior for specific needs.

It was in this context that eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology emerged.

### 2. The Development History of eBPF System

#### Early Stage: From BPF to eBPF

In 1992, Steven McCanne and Van Jacobson developed the original BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, initially for network packet filtering. It allowed user-space programs to specify filtering conditions, receiving only packets of interest, greatly improving the efficiency of network monitoring tools.

In 2014, Alexei Starovoitov made significant improvements to BPF, introducing eBPF (extended BPF). This enhancement expanded BPF's capabilities beyond network packet filtering, transforming it into a general-purpose in-kernel virtual machine.

In 2016, Netflix adopted eBPF for performance analysis and discovered a long-standing but difficult-to-detect TCP buffer issue. Traditional tools couldn't find this problem because it required simultaneous tracking of the network stack and application layer. eBPF helped them identify system bottlenecks and improve service response times.

##### Case 2: Google's BPF Security Vulnerability

In 2017, Google discovered a security vulnerability in the eBPF verifier (CVE-2017-16995) that could be exploited for local privilege escalation. This incident prompted a comprehensive review of eBPF's security model, ultimately leading to stricter verification mechanisms.

##### Case 3: Facebook's Network Optimization

Facebook (now Meta) built a DDoS defense system in 2018 using eBPF's XDP functionality. Previously, their network defense system required dedicated hardware. With eBPF, they could implement efficient DDoS defense on standard servers, significantly reducing costs.

### 3. eBPF Challenges and Opportunities in the Distributed Systems Era
