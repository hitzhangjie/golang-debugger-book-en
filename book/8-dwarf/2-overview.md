## DWARF Content Overview

### Content Overview

Most modern programming languages adopt a block structure: each entity (for example, a class definition or function) is contained within another entity. Each file in a C program may contain multiple data definitions, multiple variable definitions, and multiple functions. Within each C function, there may be several data definitions, followed by a list of executable statements. A statement may be a compound statement, which can contain data definitions and simpler executable statements. This creates lexical scopes, where names are only visible within the scope where they are defined. To find the definition of a specific symbol in a program, one first looks in the current scope, then in successive enclosing scopes until the symbol is found. The same name may have multiple definitions in different scopes. Naturally, the compiler represents the program internally as a tree.

DWARF follows this model, and its Debugging Information Entries (DIE) are also block-structured. Each description entry is contained within a parent description entry and can contain child description entries. A node may also contain one or more sibling description entries. Therefore, the DWARF DIE data of a program is also a tree structure, similar to the syntax tree built during compiler operation, where each node can have child nodes or sibling nodes. These nodes can represent types, variables, or functions.

DWARF DIE can be extended in a unified way (such as extending DIE Tags and Attributes) so that debuggers can recognize and ignore extensions, even if they may not understand their meaning. This is much better than most other debugging formats that report fatal errors when encountering unknown data. DWARF's design philosophy is also to support more programming languages and features through extensions, without being limited to specific architectures or endianness.

In addition to the DIE data (.debug_info) mentioned above, there are other important types of data in DWARF, such as the line number table (.debug_line), call stack information table (.debug_frame), macro information (.debug_macro), and accelerated access table information (.debug_pubnames, .debug_pubtype, .debug_pubranges), etc. Due to space limitations, it's difficult to cover all the details of the DWARF debugging information standard in one chapter, especially considering that DWARF v4 alone has 325 pages. To gain a more in-depth and detailed understanding of this content, one needs to read the DWARF debugging information standard.

Although DWARF was initially designed for the ELF file format, its design supports extension to other file formats. Overall, DWARF is now the most widely used debugging information format, thanks to its standardization, completeness, and continuous evolution. It is not only adopted by mainstream programming languages but is also constantly improving to meet new requirements. While other debugging information formats exist, DWARF has become the de facto standard due to its advantages.
