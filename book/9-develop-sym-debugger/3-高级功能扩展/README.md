## Advanced Feature Extensions

In previous chapters, we covered in detail the core functionality design and implementation of the debugger, including process control, breakpoint management, call stack analysis and other basic features. These functions form the core framework of a debugger.

However, to build a truly practical debugger, these basic functions alone are not enough. There are many detailed features and extensions that, while not essential, can greatly enhance the debugger's usability and practical value. These features include:

- Integration of scripting engine (starlark) to support user-written automated debugging scripts
- Lightweight tracing functionality based on eBPF for low-overhead program behavior analysis  
- Syntax highlighting to improve source code reading experience
- Paged output support to optimize display of large amounts of debug information
- Reading separately stored debug information to support debugging of stripped binaries
- Automatic source path mapping inference to simplify source location configuration
- Target process I/O redirection for flexible control of program input/output
- ...

In this chapter, we will dive deep into the implementation principles and specific details of these extended features. This content will help you build a more complete and user-friendly debugging tool.

Let's begin exploring these interesting and practical extensions.
